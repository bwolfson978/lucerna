# Lucerna

Roth conversion optimizer — "See your financial future clearly."

## Before you start

Read the current execution plan in `docs/planning/` and the project brief before starting work.
Ask the user which workstream or task they're picking up.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind → deployed to Vercel
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic → deployed to Railway
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude Sonnet, called from backend — never from frontend
- **Charts:** ApexCharts (standard charts) + custom SVG/HTML (bracket visualization, landing explainers)
- **Monorepo:** `frontend/` and `backend/` are independently deployable services

## Core principles

- **Deterministic engine + AI explanation layer.** The optimization engine does the math and produces a structured reasoning trace. The AI translates that trace into natural language. The AI never computes financial results.
- **Progressive disclosure.** Simplicity first, complexity on demand. Headline results up front; detailed analysis available on scroll/click.
- **Mobile-first.** All UI must be responsive from the start — many users arrive from Reddit on phones.

## Design aesthetic

The current aesthetic is **"Paper & Pine"** — a light, editorial design with warm paper backgrounds, deep pine green (#1b4332) as the brand color, ember (#f26522) reserved for costs and danger, three-font typography (Playfair Display, Inter, IBM Plex Mono), and animated, interactive explainer diagrams. When working on any frontend code, follow the design spec in `docs/design-aesthetic.md`. It defines Lucerna's visual language — colors, typography, spacing, component patterns, chart styling, and anti-patterns. Read it before building or modifying UI.

## Frontend guidelines

The UI is for financially literate people who are not financial professionals. All backend and financial concepts must be translated into plain English before reaching the user:

- "Estimated lifetime tax savings" not "NPV" or "net present value"
- "Impact on after-tax wealth (today's dollars)" not "discounted cash flow"
- "Projected balance" not "terminal value"
- Show multiple scenarios and tradeoffs, not a single "optimal" directive
- **No emdashes (—) in user-facing copy.** They look AI-generated. Use commas, periods, colons, or rewrite the sentence instead. This applies to all visible text: headings, descriptions, tooltips, labels, placeholders. Code comments are fine.

The AI conversation layer must use educational framing (legal requirement):
- Never "you should" — use "the analysis shows" / "based on your inputs"
- Frame outputs as scenario analysis, not financial advice

## Backend guidelines

- All API inputs and outputs use Pydantic models
- Engine code lives in `app/engine/`, API routes in `app/api/`, tools in `app/tools/`, the agent harness in `app/agent/`, the MCP server in `app/mcp/`
- **Tools are transport-neutral** (`app/tools/`): Pydantic inputs with generated schemas, shared by the web agent (`POST /api/agent`) and the remote MCP server (`/mcp`). Add a capability there once; both surfaces get it.
- The scenario draft (`app/tools/draft.py`) mirrors the calculator form; `frontend/src/lib/scenario/draft.ts` must stay in parity (shared fixtures in `shared/fixtures/`, regenerate with `python -m scripts.generate_draft_fixtures`)
- Methodology copy lives in `backend/app/content/methodology.json` with an identical copy at `frontend/src/content/methodology.json`
- The reasoning trace (`app/engine/trace.py`) is the contract between engine and AI — keep it structured and complete
- **Multi-year optimizer** is the only engine mode — `scipy.optimize.minimize` (SLSQP) with greedy bracket-fill heuristic as initialization and fallback. No separate single-year path; a 1-year timeline is just `len(income_timeline) == 1`.
- Engine files: `types.py` → `tax.py` → `heuristic.py` → `optimizer.py` → `trace.py` → `demo.py`

## Linting and formatting

- **Frontend:** ESLint 9 flat config (`frontend/eslint.config.mjs`) with `typescript-eslint`, `@next/eslint-plugin-next`, and `react-hooks` rules. Prettier (`frontend/.prettierrc`) handles formatting, including Tailwind class sorting. Configs are tuned to catch real bugs without nitpicking style.
- **Backend:** Ruff handles linting and formatting (config in `backend/pyproject.toml`). Replaces flake8/black/isort in a single tool. Rules: `E`, `F`, `W`, `I`, `UP`, `B`, `SIM`.
- **Pre-commit hooks:** husky + lint-staged auto-fix staged files and block commits with remaining errors. Setup runs automatically via `npm install` at the repo root (via the `prepare` script).
- **CI:** Both `test.yml` and the deploy workflows run lint and format checks before tests.

Commands (from repo root):
- `npm run lint:all` — lint both frontend and backend
- `npm run format:all` — autoformat both frontend and backend
- `npm run format:check` — check formatting without modifying files
- `npm run lint:frontend` / `npm run lint:backend` — scope to one service
- `npm run format:frontend` / `npm run format:backend` — scope to one service

If a pre-commit hook blocks you on something you believe is correct, fix the root cause rather than using `--no-verify`. The hook catches real issues; bypassing it pushes the problem to CI.

## Current scope boundaries

Check the active execution plan in `docs/planning/` for what's in scope for the current milestone. Don't build features from future milestones unless asked.

## GitHub CLI

When using `gh` commands, always pass the explicit `--repo bwolfson978/lucerna` flag
(or use `gh api repos/bwolfson978/lucerna/...`) rather than relying on the git remote
to infer the repository. This ensures commands work in all environments, including
Claude Code web sessions where the git remote points to a local proxy.

If `gh auth status` fails, check whether `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in
the environment before asking the user to authenticate.

## Git Operations

Any time you are starting an implementation by checking out a new feature branch, make sure you've pulled the most recent changes from master branch so you're building on top of them

## GitHub Issue Workflow

### For scout agents (filing issues)
- Always apply `status:open` and the appropriate `type:` label
- Write clear reproduction steps or rationale

### For builder agents (picking up issues)
- Only pick issues labeled `status:open`
- Immediately relabel to `status:claimed` before starting work
- When opening a PR, relabel to `status:in-review` and link the issue
- If blocked, relabel `status:blocked` and leave a comment explaining why

### Ingesting screenshots from GitHub issues
GitHub issue screenshots are hosted at `github.com/user-attachments/...` URLs that require authentication. To view them:

```bash
# 1. Extract image URL(s) from the issue body
IMG_URL=$(gh issue view <NUMBER> --json body -q .body | grep -oP 'https://[^ )"]+')

# 2. Download with authenticated gh api
gh api -H "Accept: application/octet-stream" "$IMG_URL" > issue_screenshot.png
```

Then use the Read tool on the downloaded `.png` — it renders images visually (multimodal). Always do this when an issue contains screenshots so you understand the full context before planning or implementing.

### Label reference
- status:open | status:claimed | status:in-review | status:done | status:blocked
- type:bug | type:improvement | type:refactor
- priority:high | priority:low
